# Platypus-InsertDetection

A **FiveM logging system** that detects when players press the "Insert" key, commonly used by cheaters to open cheat menus. This system helps administrators track potential cheaters and suspicious behavior on the server.

## Features

- **Player ID**: Logs the player's unique identifier when the Insert key is pressed.
- **Player Position**: Logs the player's in-game position at the moment the Insert key is pressed.
- **Live Snapshot**: Captures a screenshot or visual snapshot of the player when the Insert key is pressed.

## Usage

- **Detection**: When the Insert key is pressed, a log is sent to a configured **Discord webhook**. This allows server admins to monitor potential cheat menu usage in real-time.
- **Customization**: The menu title and color can be easily customized to suit your preferences.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Add the script to your **FiveM server** resources folder.
3. Configure the **Discord webhook** in the script to send logs to your server's Discord channel.
4. Customize the menu title and color if desired.
5. Restart the server, and the system will begin logging Insert key presses.
